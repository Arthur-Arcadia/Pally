# Pally Discord bot

Use `/social` to open a three-button panel in the current channel. The user who triggers the command should not be visible to other channel members.

**Funny Exit** supports a private preview of an English excuse, with options to generate another excuse, send it, or cancel.

**Portrait** and **Random Picker** only allow members of the bound game voice channel to participate in the designated text channel.

For **Portrait**, selecting one word immediately submits the response and closes the private controls. Once all participants have submitted, the result is displayed immediately. Otherwise, the system waits for a maximum of 10 seconds. Participants who do not select a word are treated as having submitted a blank response. Results are generated using local English templates, with no external AI service.

**Random Picker** selects participants using a fair rotation system. Only the selected participant can choose **`I'll Invite Someone`** to complete the current round or **`Pass / Draw Again`** to redraw. The round ends when everyone passes/leaves or when there has been no response for 60 seconds.

The voice-channel member list is synchronized automatically. New members who join the voice channel will participate starting from the next round.

Runtime configuration uses `GUILD_ID`, `GAME_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID`, and `SOCIAL_TEXT_CHANNEL_ID` from `.env.sample`.

For Docker deployment, keep `STATE_DIR=/app/data` and the volume mapping `-v mermer-data:/app/data`. The two features maintain their rotation records separately. Private word selections and interaction tokens must not be written to data files.

After making updates, rebuild the image and replace the running container. Then use `/social` to open the new panel. No additional command registration is required.

Testing is performed with `npm test`, without connecting to or calling the real Discord service.

The original [Deployment Guide](./PANEL.md) is retained as an early deployment reference. The pending-state behavior and Portrait timing rules described in this section take precedence over the original documentation.

The following is an inherited Discord introductory example document. The game features and file structure shown in the example do not represent the current implementation.

Production deployment uses **EC2 + Caddy** and does not require a public tunnel on the local machine.


## Original starter guide

This project contains a basic rock-paper-scissors-style Discord app written in JavaScript, built for the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

![Demo of app](https://github.com/discord/discord-example-app/raw/main/assets/getting-started-demo.gif?raw=true)

## Project structure
Below is a basic overview of the project structure:

```
├── examples    -> short, feature-specific sample apps
│   ├── app.js  -> finished app.js code
│   ├── button.js
│   ├── command.js
│   ├── modal.js
│   ├── selectMenu.js
├── .env.sample -> sample .env file
├── app.js      -> main entrypoint for app
├── commands.js -> slash command payloads + helpers
├── game.js     -> logic specific to RPS
├── utils.js    -> utility functions and enums
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

## Running app locally

Before you start, you'll need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [create a Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the proper permissions:
- `applications.commands`
- `bot` (with Send Messages enabled)


Configuring the app is covered in detail in the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

### Setup project

First clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/discord/discord-example-app.git
```

Then navigate to its directory and install dependencies:
```
cd discord-example-app
npm install
```
### Get app credentials

Fetch the credentials from your app's settings and add them to a `.env` file (see `.env.sample` for an example). You'll need your app ID (`APP_ID`), bot token (`DISCORD_TOKEN`), and public key (`PUBLIC_KEY`).

Fetching credentials is covered in detail in the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

> 🔑 Environment variables can be added to the `.env` file in Glitch or when developing locally, and in the Secrets tab in Replit (the lock icon on the left).

### Install slash commands

The commands for the example app are set up in `commands.js`. All of the commands in the `ALL_COMMANDS` array at the bottom of `commands.js` will be installed when you run the `register` command configured in `package.json`:

```
npm run register
```

### Run the app

After your credentials are added, go ahead and run the app:

```
node app.js
```

> ⚙️ A package [like `nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), which watches for local changes and restarts your app, may be helpful while locally developing.

If you aren't following the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started), you can move the contents of `examples/app.js` (the finished `app.js` file) to the top-level `app.js`.

### Set up interactivity

The project needs a public endpoint where Discord can send requests. To develop and test locally, you can use something like [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel HTTP traffic.

Install ngrok if you haven't already, then start listening on port `3000`:

```
ngrok http 3000
```

You should see your connection open:

```
Tunnel Status                 online
Version                       2.0/2.0
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io -> localhost:3000

Connections                  ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

Copy the forwarding address that starts with `https`, in this case `https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io`, then go to your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

On the **General Information** tab, there will be an **Interactions Endpoint URL**. Paste your ngrok address there, and append `/interactions` to it (`https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io/interactions` in the example).

Click **Save Changes**, and your app should be ready to run 🚀
